# What's this?
This program try making a obfuscated binary into a deobfuscated binary.
Deobfuscated binary makes static analysis much easier.

# Notice
This repository is just created for a graduation thesis.
And, after that I changed my research project, so this program is imcomplete.
Due to this reason, usage instruction and input file format aren't described here.

I recommend you shouldn't use this program.
